this folder contains the time consumption result of CUDA and single-core CPU using method dijkstra.

To achieve this, we generated a graph large enough (20000000 vertices and 218000000 directed edges) to test on a personal laptop, making it impossible to copy the graph data directly to the video memory. Then we compared the computation results and computation time spent for both.

The configuration of the personal PC is as follows:

> a personal laptop with Intel i7-8550U CPU, 16G DDR4 2400MHz memory and Nvidia GeForce MX150 (2G video memory) was used for the external test.
